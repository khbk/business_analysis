# Business Analysis

--- 

## Intro

Using the collected data from my personal family's business, I worked to create a visible correlation between three different stores (Kent, Burien and University Place). Ever since opening the business in 2017, my family recorded each sales everyday to see the growth of the business. Data were collected over Google Sheets and downloaded as Comma Separated Values (CSV) file.

## Problem Statement:

Taking the collected real life data, how can I make it comprehendable to my clients? In this case, my parents.
